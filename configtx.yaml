Organizations:

  # Org3MSP defines an MSP using the sampleconfig. It should never be used
  # in production but may be used as a template for other definitions.
  -
    # Name is the key by which this org will be referenced in channel
    # configuration transactions.
    # Name can include alphanumeric characters as well as dots and dashes.
    Name: Org3MSP

    # SkipAsForeign can be set to true for org definitions which are to be
    # inherited from the orderer system channel during channel creation.  This
    # is especially useful when an admin of a single org without access to the
    # MSP directories of the other orgs wishes to create a channel.  Note
    # this property must always be set to false for orgs included in block
    # creation.
    SkipAsForeign: false

    # ID is the key by which this org's MSP definition will be referenced.
    # ID can include alphanumeric characters as well as dots and dashes.
    ID: Org3MSP

    # MSPDir is the filesystem path which contains the MSP configuration.
    MSPDir: crypto-config/peerOrganizations/Org3MSP/msp
    MSPType: bccsp

    # Policies defines the set of policies at this level of the config tree
    # For organization policies, their canonical path is usually
    #   /Channel/<Application|Orderer>/<OrgName>/<PolicyName>
